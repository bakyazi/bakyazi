### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am Berkay AkyazÄ±
I live in Ankara, Turkey. I'm a full stack developer. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities. I am passionate about learning new technologies and are constantly trying to improve.

I've been learning programming since I was a kid. When I was in elementary school, I started using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript a little. After I started studying, I learned about the programming languages Python and C / C++, and my passion for programming began. After that, I met Java in a summer internship. Since then, I've been writing Java in my professional career.

Besides Java, I use Python, Golang, React and Vue.js in my professional career and everyday life. I love Python for small hands-on projects and web crawls. React is usually my first choice for front-end work. I am currently studying Golang and am very passionate about it.
